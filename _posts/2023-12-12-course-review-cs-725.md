### Feedback on Lectures

- Teaching Style: On the positive side, the instructor exhibited excellent communication skills, delivering complex concepts with clarity, and showcasing a profound knowledge of the subject matter. The incorporation of hands-on visual demonstrations in class added a practical dimension to theoretical concepts, enhancing the overall learning experience. However, the lectures were fast-paced, covering a substantial amount of content in a short time, which, while comprehensive, might have made it challenging for some students to fully absorb the material. Additionally, there was an assumption of a certain level of mathematical understanding, potentially leaving some students at a disadvantage. The limited time dedicated to in-depth problem-solving during class sessions could be improved to provide students with more opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.
- Attendence: Not taken.

### Feedback on Assignments and Exams

- Weightage: Assignments - 12%, Scibes - 3%, Project - 15%, SAFE quizzes - 10%, Midsem - 25%, Endsem - 35%
- Pattern: The homework assignments were generally considered manageable, with a level of difficulty deemed easy. Proficiency in Python was emphasized as a prerequisite for solving these assignments, adding a practical programming component to the coursework. The SAFE quizzes, while also regarded as easy, required diligent revision of class material for successful completion. On the contrary, the exams were perceived as exceptionally challenging, featuring a plethora of "what if" type questions. Success in these exams demanded a very high level of analytical thinking, reflecting a rigorous assessment of the students' understanding and application of the course content.

### Difficulty Level

The overall difficulty level of the course was deemed moderate by students. While the exams presented a challenge, with advanced topics like transformers, GPT, and BERT requiring additional effort, the core course content was generally considered manageable. The course content was labeled as easy, provided students had a comprehensive understanding of every little detail. Notably, the course demanded a significant time investment for completing homework and preparing for exams, making it unsuitable for last-minute preparation. The syllabus, though extensive, was open-notes during exams, providing students with the opportunity to reference their materials.

### Prerequisites

While CS 725 doesn't have formal prerequisites, a strong foundation in key areas can significantly enhance your learning experience. Proficiency in Python is essential, as the coursework involves practical implementation, particularly in homework assignments. Familiarity with basic linear algebra, multi-variable calculus and probability is beneficial, providing a solid groundwork for understanding machine learning concepts.
