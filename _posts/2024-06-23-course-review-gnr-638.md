### Feedback on Lectures

- Teaching Style: While the instructor demonstrated excellent communication skills, the courseâ€™s fast-paced nature often assumed a significant amount of prior knowledge on ML and probability theory, which could be challenging for some students. Despite these challenges, the instructor excelled in providing valuable resources that greatly supplemented the learning experience. However, the slides could benefit from better organization and increased depth to align with the course requirements, particularly for the mathematically rigorous exams. For students willing to engage deeply with the provided materials and seek additional help as needed, this course offers a comprehensive and rewarding exploration of deep learning techniques in computer vision.
- Attendence: Taken.

### Feedback on Assignments and Exams

- Weightage: Assignments - 0% (Negative if not submitted), Quizzes - 10%, Blog post - 10%, Midsem - 20%, Two Mini projects - 30%, Endsem - 30%
- Pattern: The mini projects, while time-consuming, provided valuable hands-on experience, though the evaluation based entirely on metric scores was seen as less than ideal by some students. The mid-semester and end-semester exams were notably difficult and highly mathematical, requiring a solid understanding of the theoretical concepts. The blog post assignment was a more balanced component, providing a good opportunity for reflection and synthesis. Overall, the evaluation was strict, but it ensured a deep and thorough understanding of the material for those who persevered.

### Difficulty Level

The course strikes a balance between accessibility and challenge. While the mini projects are manageable and offer practical insights, the exams are notably more demanding, requiring a solid grasp of mathematical concepts. To excel in these assessments, a significant amount of self-study is essential. Overall, the course is of moderate difficulty, providing a comprehensive and rewarding learning experience for those willing to invest the necessary time and effort.

### Prerequisites

While the course has no formal prerequisites, it is designed with the expectation that students are well-versed in the basics of machine learning. A solid understanding of neural networks, including CNN and RNN architectures, is assumed. Although probability topics are crucial for the coursework, they will not be covered in the lectures, requiring students to have prior knowledge in this area. On a positive note, the instructor does not assume any prior experience with generative models such as VAEs and GANs, making this aspect of the course more accessible to all students.
