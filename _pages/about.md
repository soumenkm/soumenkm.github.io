## About Me

I am Soumen Mondal, currently pursuing my M.S. by Research in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the [Center of Machine Intelligence and Data Science (CMInDS)](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/) of [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). My academic journey has been driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to advancing knowledge in ML field and I am expected to be graduated from IIT Bombay in 2025.

Throughout my academic career, I have pursued excellence in every endeavor. My journey began at [Jadavpur University, Kolkata](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/), where I earned my B.Tech in Civil Engineering from the department of [Civil Engineering](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/academics/civil-engineering/), graduating with a strong foundation in engineering principles. My quest for deeper knowledge led me to the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc)](https://iisc.ac.in/), where I completed my M.Tech in Structural Engineering from the department of [Civil Engineering](http://www.civil.iisc.ac.in/), further honing my analytical and problem-solving skills.

My professional journey in the industry has been both enriching and impactful, particularly during my tenure at [General Electric (GE) Vernova](https://www.gevernova.com/) in Bengaluru.

Currently, at IIT Bombay, I am focused on research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications on LLMs. My collaboration with [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/) on localizing text across domains and my exploration of cross-lingual knowledge transfer in multi-lingual language models are just a few examples of my research interests and capabilities.
